                 It is maximum size of result set that might be fetched. This value is the sum of all separate partitions limits.
                 Whole limit <b>distributed through partitions evenly</b>.
                 I.e. if limit = 100 and given topic has 6 partitions,
                 after fetch in a result set will be 16 records for every partition.
                 If there is not enough rooms to fetch limit records from some partition,
                 then maximum available records will be fetched.

             </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Now maximum summary limit might be chosen as 100 records.
