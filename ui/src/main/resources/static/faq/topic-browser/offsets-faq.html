    <p>Fetch offsets table how to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The offsets table consists from five columns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Partition column:</b> This column displays the order number of each partition.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Check column:</b> This column contains checkboxes to limit the result set to the necessary partitions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>MIN column:</b> This column shows the minimum offset for each partition.<br/>
                        The "[" symbol before the value indicates that this minimum offset is included in the range,
                        while "(" means the offset is excluded from the range.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>FIRST BATCH column:</b> This column displays the minimum offset of the fetched range for each partition.<br/>
                        The "[" symbol indicates that this minimum offset is included in the range, while "(" means the offset is excluded
                        from the range. After the first fetch, the value in this column may be greater than the value in the MIN column.
                        This is normal behavior because in rare cases, Kafka may return the beginning of the current segment as the minimum
                        offset for the given partition. The real minimum offset for the current partition will be available in this column only
                        after the first fetch.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>LAST BATCH column:</b> This column shows the maximum offset for each partition within the fetched range.<br/>
                        The "]" symbol indicates that this maximum offset is included in the range, while ")" means the offset is excluded from the range.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>MAX column:</b> This column displays the maximum offset for each partition.<br/>
                        The "]" symbol indicates that this maximum offset is included in the range, while ")" means the offset is excluded
                        from the range.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                During the fetch operation, the next offset range in the "FIRST BATCH" and "LAST BATCH" columns will start blinking and appear
                in green color. If the values in these columns do not change color, it indicates that there is no suitable data in that partition,
                and the offset values remain unchanged.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                There are also two buttons available: <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/to-min-button.png"/> and <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/to-max-button.png"/>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/to-min-button.png"/>: <b>"Set fetched range to the beginning"</b>:
                        Pressing this button will set the "FIRST BATCH" offset to the "MIN" value for each partition.<br/>
                        This action ensures that any subsequent fetch operation starts from the beginning of the topic.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/to-max-button.png"/> Pressing this button will increase the values in the "LAST BATCH"
                        offset column to the "MAX" value for each partition.<br/>
                        The values in the "FIRST BATCH" column will be set to "LAST BATCH" value minus the limit of records for the current partition.
                        This operation retrieves the most recent records for the given topic.
                    </p>
