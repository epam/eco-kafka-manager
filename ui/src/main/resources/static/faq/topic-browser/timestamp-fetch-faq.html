    <p>Timestamp fetch how to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>To retrieve data based on time, follow these steps:<br/></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Select the appropriate date and time.</li>
                <li>2. Press one of the buttons <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/time-fetch-backward-button.png"/> or
                    <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/time-fetch-forward-button.png"/>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                If you press the button <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/time-fetch-backward-button.png"/> for <b>"Backward fetch"</b>,
                KM will search for the first record with a timestamp <b>greater than or equal</b> to the chosen timestamp.
                It will then fetch records in a <b>backward direction</b> until the number of fetched records reaches the limit (default is 100) or
                until there are not enough records. If there aren't enough records, KM will fetch all the records from the beginning of the partition
                up to the record with the chosen timestamp. The result of the backward fetch will be a set of records where the last record's timestamp
                is greater than or equal to the chosen timestamp, with a size limited by the set limit or from the first record of the partition.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                If you press the button <img src="/kafka-manager/faq/topic-browser/img/time-fetch-forward-button.png"/> for <b>"Forward fetch"</b>,
                KM will search for the first record with a timestamp <b>greater than or equal</b> to the chosen timestamp.
                It will then fetch records in a <b>forward direction</b> until the number of fetched records reaches the limit (default is 100)
                or until there are not enough records. If there aren't enough records, KM will fetch all the records from the record with the chosen timestamp
                up to the end of each partition. The result of the forward fetch will be a set of records where the first record's timestamp is greater than or equal
                to the chosen timestamp, with a size limited by the set limit or until the end of the partition.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                The total limit of records will be <b>evenly distributed across partitions</b>.<br/>
                For example, if the limit is set to 100 and the given topic has 6 partitions, the result message table will contain 16 records
                for each partition after the fetch operation.
