                Filtering data can be performed in three different ways, depending on the type of data:
                <b>String</b>, <b>Numeric</b> and <b>Enum</b>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>String</b> data type. You can use operations such as "equals", "contains", "like" and "not empty".
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Numeric</b> data type. Available operations include "Greater than", "Less than" and "equals".
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Enum</b> data type. This is a filtering option with a limited number of values. The only available
                        operation is "equals".
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <li>

                <b>Filter options</b>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Group name:</b> This allows you to filter by consumer group name, which is a string value.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Storage type:</b> filter by storage type. This option lets you filter by storage type, an Enum value.
                        Two possible options are <b>"KAFKA"</b> and <b>"ZOOKEEPER"</b>.
                        In older Kafka versions, information about consumer groups was stored in <b>Zookeeper</b>,
                        but since Kafka 0.10, consumer group lists are stored in <b>Kafka</b>, in "__consumer_offsets" topic.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Group state:</b> An Enum value representing the state of the consumer group. Possible states are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                <b>Unknown</b>: No information about consumer group state
                            </p>
                        </li>

                                <b>PreparingRebalance</b>: A change requiring partition reassignment is happening,
                                so Kafka is in the middle of rebalancing process.
                            </p>

                                <b>Stable</b>: Rebalancing is complete, and consumers are functioning as expected.
                            </p>

                                <b>Dead</b>: The group will be removed from this Kafka node soon. This may be due to inactivity,
                                or the group could be migrating to a different group coordinator.

                        The record will be accepted if at least one topic name meets the condition.
