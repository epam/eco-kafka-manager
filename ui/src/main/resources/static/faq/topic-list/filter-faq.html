            <p>The filter operations can be applied to various <b>types of columns</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>String:</b> All columns of string type support the following operations:
                        <b>"equals"</b>, <b>"contains"</b>, <b>"like"</b> and <b>"not empty"</b>.
                        The <b>"like"</b> operation is similar to SQL's LIKE operator and allows the use of the "%" symbol.
                        For example, if you need to select all records that contain the words "staff" and "roles,"
                        the filter expression would be "%staff%roles%".
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Numeric:</b> Columns of numeric type require the operations "Greater than," "Less than," and "equals".
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Enum:</b> Columns of enum type only require the "equals" operation. This type has a limited array of values.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>JSON:</b> Columns of JSON type support the operations <b>"equals"</b>, <b>"contains"</b>, <b>"like"</b> and <b>"not empty"</b> operations.<br/>.
                        These operations are applied to specific fields within the JSON. To use them, you should use the notation "field name: value;".
                        For example, to select all records where the field "field" is equal to "value," you would use the "equals" operation with the value
                        "field:value".
                    </p>
